============

last_letter is the fruit of the efforts of more than one person:

 * `George Zogopoulos - Papaliakos <https://github.com/Georacer>`_: Main author and maintainer.
 * Panos Marantos: His code for a ROS simulator of an RC helicopter, used for his PhD research was used as an inspiration and a base for last_letter.
 * `Fadi Samisti <https://github.com/Fil0x>`_: Creator of the gauges of ``rqt_dashboard`` package and counsellor in software engineering matters.
 * `Andrew Tridgel <https://github.com/tridge>`_: Fixed the interfacing structure between last_letter and the APM:Plane SITL
 * The Sphinx template for this documentation webpage was based on the `MAVProxy <http://dronecode.github.io/MAVProxy/html/index.html>`_ documentation, written by Steven Dade.
