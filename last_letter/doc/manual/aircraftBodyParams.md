## Rigid Body Parameters

These are found in the file `rigidBody.yaml` and assign values to the rigid-body quantities of the aircraft.

`m` Mass of the aircraft (in kg).

`J_*` The element of the matrix of inertia of the aircraft. So far, only `J_x`, `J_y`, `J_z` and `J_xz` are supported, but the intention is to add support for a full inertia matrix.
